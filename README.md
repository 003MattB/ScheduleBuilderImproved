# ScheduleBuilderImproved
I came up with the idea when trying to create a class schedule that fit my busy schedule. Schedule Builder works alright, but it only auto-generates 15 schedules; this limits the possibilities. What I ended up doing was writing on note cards all the classes I might take, and all their sections. I created a weekly schedule (Monday - Friday) and began arranging the cards in an order that classes didn't conflict with times, and I was able to get all the credits I needed. I was able to achieve what Schedule Builder was unable to by manually re-aranging cards. At times there were conflicts, but I manually resolved them. Schedule Builder Improved aims to do just that. It gives the user more control over the shedule that regular Schedule Builder, allowing for more options. 

So as to still make it convenient for the user, this tool will use umn-asr/courses API to pull course information from the University of Minnesota's server and present the info in a meaningful way. 

### Caveats
- It automatically sets the next term, so you are not able to configure a schedule for a current term. 
- You need a knowledge of courses offered in order to add them to the schedule.
- (as of right now) It will only retrieve data for the Twin Cities campus (sorry Duluth, Moris, Crookston and Rochester)
